# NN-versucht
Neural Network trials: 

The Fashion-MNIST dataset consists of images in a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image associated with a label from 10 classes. Using PyTorch, I employed this data to create models, optimize their parameters, and save the trained models.    

The goal was to utilize the Fashion-MNIST dataset to train a neural network capable of predicting whether an input image belongs to one of the following classes: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, or Ankle boot.    

Additionally, I experimented with different neural networks (NN) to determine if the model achieved the highest accuracy percentage and lowest average loss within the same number of epochs. These models ranged from linear NN to one-dimensional convolutional NN and two-dimensional convolutional NN.
